Simple program is oftn times the most secure one. So Simplicity is a very important principle in cyber security.

# Simplicity_Example:
This program calculates the natural logarithm of a variable (lnx) using the built in C++ library function. Hence the operation can be performed in two lines code.

# Simplicity_NonExample:
The same operation was performed using different appraoch called the Tayler series. This computation was implemented in this example in two different functions. The first one is more complex than the second one. Because it involved many variables and complicated logic. While the second one which is a little bit simpler uses the library function pow() to compute power of a number, but still it is not in its simplest form. Both those functions require many variables which are available to the outside world which is not good.
