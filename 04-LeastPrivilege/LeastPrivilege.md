Least Privilege is to give a user a minimum permission.
# LeastPrivilege_Example: 
This is good example of least privilege. The two users in the in this example (firstuser and seconduser) have different permissions within the class. 
# LeastPrivilege_NonExample: 
This is bad example of least privilege. Because all the users have access to all the functions in all the classes.
