# Homework 2: 10 Foundational-Concepts-in-Cybersecurity
# 1 Domain separation :
Separating areas where resources are located prevents accidents and loss of data, keeping information worlds from colliding.
# 2 Process isolation:
A process occurs when a task is executed. Keeping processes separate prevents the failure of one process from negatively impacting another.
# 3 Resource encapsulation:
Resources - hardware, system objects, or processes - must be separated and used as intended.
# 4 Least privilege:
Limits what access people have to your resources and anything that they can do with them.
# 5 Modularity:
The ability to be inserted or removed from a project; each module has its own function, interchangeable with other modules.
# 6 Layering:
Multiple layers of defense protect information. If one layer is defeated, the next layer should catch it.
# 7 Abstraction:
Summarizing or explaining in a way that can be easily understood by everyone.
# 8 Data hiding:
An attempt to prevent people from being able to see information.
# 9 Simplicity:
If something is less complicated, it's less likely to have problems and easier to troubleshoot and fix.
# 10 Minimization:
Simplify and decrease the number of ways the software can be exploited.
