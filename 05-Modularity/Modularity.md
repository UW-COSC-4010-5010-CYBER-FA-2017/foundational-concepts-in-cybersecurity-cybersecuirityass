Modularity is dividing a program into separated sub-programs:
# Modularity_Example:
In this good modularity example the process of converting from fahrenheit to celsus program is divided into three sub programs (functions). Getinput, convert and dispaly functions (modules) were developed separately and put together to make a complete process. Each module can be debuged and modified very easly.

# Modularity_Non Example:
This is bad example of modularity because the entire conversion program is written inside the main program. Which is not good. Modifying this will completely affect the entire program.
