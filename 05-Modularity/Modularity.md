Modularity is dividing a program into separated sub-programs:
# Modularity_Example:
In this good modularity example the process of converting from fahrenheit to celsus program is divided into three sub programs (functions).

# Modularity_Non Example:
This is bad example of modularity because the entire conversion program is written inside the main program. Which is not good.
